This will be the future home for some GitHub Action video content. 

## How do I watch?

All the "gitActionTraction" videos will be uploaded to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7iJhl4CsLxzKUWfAw69Qkg?view_as=subscriber) account soon. I will also share clips from my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bdougieYO). This repository will serve as a place for planning future content. 

## Where can I learn more about Actions?

The [github.community](https://github.community/c/github-actions/41) forum is the place to ask questions and find answers.
