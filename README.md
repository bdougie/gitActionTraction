This will be the future home for some GitHub Action video content. 

## How do I watch?

There will be a link to Youtube soon, for now please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bdougieYO) or the this repository to get notified when the first video is released. 

## Where can I learn more about Actions?

The [github.community](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/bd-p/actions) forum is the place to ask questions and find answers.
